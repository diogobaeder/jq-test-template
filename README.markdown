# jq-test-template
Just a project template for testing JavaScript apps. It already includes jQuery, since it's my JS framework of choice, most of the time.

## Structure
The project follows this basic file structure to start with:
- <strong>src/</strong> - directory for source files
- <strong>src/core.js</strong> - core library script
